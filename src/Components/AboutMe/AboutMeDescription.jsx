            <p>
                My journey in web development began with a strong curiosity for how technology works and how it can be used to create impactful digital experiences. This curiosity led me to explore programming and build real-world projects that solve problems.

            <p>
                I specialize in full stack development using technologies like React, Node.js, and TypeScript, and Iâ€™m familiar with deploying applications to the cloud. I enjoy learning modern tools and best practices that help me grow as a developer and deliver scalable solutions.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                Outside of coding, I like contributing to open source, writing about technology, and helping other developers grow through mentoring and collaboration.
